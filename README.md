Supply Chain Forecasting for Inventory Management
This repository contains a comprehensive project on supply chain forecasting for inventory management. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using various machine learning algorithms.
## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages for the project.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/supply-chain-forecasting.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd supply-chain-forecasting
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data and perform preprocessing.
2. Run the scripts in the `src/` directory to train and evaluate the models.
3. Use the trained models to make predictions on new data.
